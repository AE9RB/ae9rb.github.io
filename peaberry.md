## Peaberry SDR V2 $149.00

The Peaberry SDR V2 is a Software Defined Radio transceiver for the HF amateur bands (FCC part 97). It's available as a kit that you build yourself. An illustrated manual covers assembly, testing, and installation of HDSDR. Because the radio is software defined, the modes you can operate are determined by the applications running on your computer. There is software available for every known mode. You can even design your own modes if you have the expertise.

Build your Peaberry SDR V2 for the 160/80/75m, 80/75/60/40m, 60/40/30/20m, 30/20/17/15m, or 17/15/12/10m bands. All kits include parts for all bands so you do not need to decide until you are ready to start building.
